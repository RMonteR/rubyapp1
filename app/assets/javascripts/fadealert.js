// Bonus task 5.5

// You might not want to have the alerts and notices visible all the time.
// So you could get them to fade out after a certain amount of time.
//
// You can use jQuery to select all elements with the class .alert.
// You can set the time for how long they should be visible with the .delay() function.
// The .fadeOut() function added to the same line right after the .delay() function will let you fade out your alerts.
